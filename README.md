### User Story
###Background of the problem statement:

 - M-theta Technology Solutions hired you as a DevOps Architect. It is undergoing an infrastructural change to implement DevOps to develop and deliver the products. Since M-theta is an Agile organization, they follow the Scrum methodology to develop the projects incrementally. Hence, the company wants to adopt Git as a Source Code Management (SCM) tool for faster integration of work and smooth transition into DevOps.

- So, as a DevOps Architect, you have been asked to build a branching model to demonstrate the Git Feature Branch Workflow for the companyâ€™s engineering team. In the branching model, you are required to create a Production branch which will act as the main (master) branch, an Integration branch which will again have two branches inside it namely Feature 1 and Feature 2, and a Hotfix branch which will be used for fixing any issues that could come up from Integration or Production branches.
